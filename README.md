# DSC3263 Fake News Detection Model
### Project: Contextualized Fake News Detection Using Transformer Models 
## Description

Enhance the fake news detection project by leveraging transformer models, such as BERT, GPT for contextualized analysis. Instead of treating each news article as an isolated entity, consider the context and semantics of the surrounding text. By incorporating transformer-based models, the aim is to improve the accuracy and contextual understanding of fake news detection, considering the border context in which the articles are presented.

Bert model performs 97.85% accuracy on test data, whereas the BiLSTM model performs 93.65% accuracy. Our results show that the BERT model improves 4.2% of the accuracy in fake news detection compared to the BiLSTM Model.
